Voting System![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddcdf58d-f5a7-4f58-ace4-6a1b41c04c5c)

Vision
The Voting System smart contract provides a decentralized and secure way for users to vote for candidates in an election. This system allows only authenticated users (those who haven't voted yet) to cast their vote for candidates managed by the contract owner. It ensures transparency and immutability by recording all votes on the Ethereum blockchain.
